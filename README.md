# Decentralized-IoB-for-Influencing-IoT-based-Systems-Behavior


This project is the implementation of the use case proposed in "Decentralized IoB for Influencing IoT-based Systems' Behavior" paper. An electrical power consumption decetralized IoB system that influences consumer behavior to reduce power consumption process has been built with a Sequence2Sequence time series predictive model, historical data analysis, and 4 centralzied IoB systems for each sub-meter.
